## Assignment Details

### **API Explorer Web Application**

#### **Overview:**

In this assignment, you will embark on a journey to build a web application that utilizes an API of your choice to fetch, interact with, and present data in a unique and interactive way.

This is an **individual** assignment, but we highly encourage you to chat with your teammates as you each complete your own assignment (just make sure you all use different APIs). This is because communication keeps teams strong and the peer support you can get from one another is priceless! :)

Note: Even though the deadline is 2 weeks out, we  **highly recommend**  completing the assignment in the first week as there will be a new assignment every week covering what you learned that week!

#### **Objective:**

Create a web application that serves as a creative interface between the end-user and the data you fetch from an API. Your application should provide a valuable or entertaining experience by displaying, organizing, or manipulating the data in an innovative manner.

#### **Requirements:**

1.  Choose  **one** API from the list of free APIs below (Example Projects to choose from), or find one that sparks your interest. Use the API documentations to get your API key and make requests to the API.
2.  Design a website in  **HTML/CSS/JS, not React,** that will use the data provided to give your users a meaningful way to interact with the data. Be creative! What kind of websites to you use everyday that uses similar data?  _(See  [Lecture 56Links to an external site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtIdmfBSoHw&list=PLpYu7Wkyi5ruXL-HBsw61NmqZy2yLEqXc&index=62)  for an example)_
3.  Your web application must be able to fetch data asynchronously from the chosen API and present it to the user. Your application must have GET and POST requests, minimum. We highly encourage using PUT and DELETE as well for practice (but some APIs don't have these endpoints)! Make sure your program handles errors properly as well. Try your best to include multiple endpoints!
    
4.  Craft a user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Your design should enhance the user's ability to interact with the data and understand it at a glance.
    
5.  Accompany your project with documentation including inline comments and a README file that describes
    
6.  Be sure to use Git for version control and upload your code to GitHub!

**Deliverables:**

1.  **Deploy your website**  using  [Github PagesLinks to an external site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbLljKIlxGg&list=PLpYu7Wkyi5ruXL-HBsw61NmqZy2yLEqXc&index=56), Netlify or Render or[a similar platformLinks to an external site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhCmDFh_JU&list=PLpYu7Wkyi5ruXL-HBsw61NmqZy2yLEqXc&index=57 "Link")and submit a link to your website.
2.  Submit a  **link to your GitHub repo, please make it public (in the text submission),** **and a link to your website (deployed link)**
